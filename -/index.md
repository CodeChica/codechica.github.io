[Code Chica](./) is our free program for students in 8th-12th grade. While enrolled in Code Chica, you will be placed in a cohort of students to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript essentials and explore careers in computer science, engineering, and more! Over 8 weeks, you will curate your very own customized website which you will feature as part of your coding portfolio. The workshop culminates in a graduation showcase on the last class day, where you will present your project. Upon completion of the program, you will receive a $75 stipend and a certificate outlining your accomplishments. 

Since 2019, Latinitas has delivered 12 Code Chica cohorts, 8 week long sessions, graduating a total of 117 students. *Welcome Cohort 13!*
