# GitHub

[GitHub][github] is a website that lets us save our [git](./git.html) repositories for free.
It is the largest code hosting platform on the planet. It's a great place to
create a backup of your code and collaborate with other coders.

We'll be using our [CodeChica organization on GitHub][organization] to host our
code, provide development environments via [Codespaces](#codespaces), facilitate
[discussions][discussions] and [track our progress][curriculum].

## Codespaces

We use [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) to make sure that everyone
has access to the tools and software that they need for this course
so that everyone can learn to code.

A [Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces) is a development environment
that is created just for you. You can think of it like it is your own
computer. When you create a Codespace it also comes with a bunch of tools
and software already installed. So you can focus on writing code instead of
figuring out how to install git, Linux, Ruby, Node.js etc.

### [Create my Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace)
