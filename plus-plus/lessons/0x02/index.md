# 0x02 - Tech Roles Overview

In this lesson, you will explore an overview of product manager, designer and engineering roles in tech.

By the end of this lesson you will:

* learn about Product Managers, Designer and Engineers.
* create a [User Story](./../../roles/product-manager.html#user-stories) for a new feature.
* create a [Wireframe](./../../roles/designer.html#wireframes) for a [User Story](./../../roles/product-manager.html#user-stories).

Let's meet Diana, Elena and Paola.

customers, prioritizing what work needs to be done and connecting people with
each other so that they can work together to ship great products and features.

As a Designer, Diana gets to think creatively to come up with new ideas for how
to improve user experience on websites. This might include improving page navigation,
choosing colours palettes that are friendly to people who are
visually impaired or find better ways to present data to make it easier to
understand. Diana loves to share [wireframes](./../../roles/designer.html#what-is-a-wireframe)
with her colleagues to collect feedback.

![Elena The Engineer](/assets/images/elena-the-engineer-slim.png)

Elena is a builder and loves to find pragmatic solutions to difficult problems.
As an Engineer, Elena is constantly challenged with new problems and learning
new things. Elena loves to code but she also likes to crunch numbers to make
sure that systems are performing efficiently so that the product can run
quickly. Elena can take new feature requests and break them down into smaller
pieces of work to help prioritize what order to build things and to raise any
technical concerns related to new feature requests.
