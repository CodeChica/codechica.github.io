# Diana - The Designer

As a Designer, [Diana][design] gets to think creatively to come up with new
ideas for how to improve user experience on websites. This might include
improving page navigation, choosing colours palettes that are friendly to
people who are visually impaired or find better ways to present data to make
it easier to understand.
