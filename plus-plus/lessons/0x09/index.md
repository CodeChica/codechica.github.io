# Final Project

In teams of 3 people, you will create 1 new feature for [SparkleHub][sparklehub].
Each team will choose who will be the [Product Manager][product-manager],
[Designer][designer], and [Engineer][engineer].

* The Product Manager creates a [User Story][user-story] submitted as a [new issue][issue].
* The Designer creates a [Wireframe][wireframe] of the feature submitted as an attachment in the issue.
* The Engineer creates a [Task breakdown][tasks] of the work to be done to build the feature included in the issue.
* The team submits a [Pull Request][pull-request] to the [SparkleHub][sparklehub] repo with working code.

Each member of the team will present how they contributed to the feature that they worked on together.

The following video provides an example of the full process.
