# Final Project

In teams of 3 people, you will create 1 new feature for [SparkleHub][sparklehub].
Each team will choose who will be the [Product Manager][product-manager],
[Designer][designer], and [Engineer][engineer].

* The Product Manager creates a [User Story][user-story] submitted as a [new issue][issue].
* The Designer creates a [Wireframe][wireframe] of the feature submitted as an attachment in the issue.
* The Engineer creates a [Task breakdown][tasks] of the work to be done to build the feature included in the issue.
* The team submits a [Pull Request][pull-request] to the [SparkleHub][sparklehub] repo with working code.

Each member of the team will present how they contributed to the feature that they worked on together.

## Example

```plaintext
User Story:

As a Sparkler,
I want it to rain confetti when I send a Sparkle,
so that I know that my Sparkle has been sent.

Acceptance Criteria:

* Rainbow coloured confetti will rain down when a new Sparkle is created.
* The confetti will stop raining when it reaches the bottom of the screen.
* The text "You sent a Sparkle!" will appear behind the confetti.
