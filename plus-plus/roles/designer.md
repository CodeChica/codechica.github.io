Designers and Engineers work together to build features together. There are many
different types of Design such as:

* Accessibility
* Interaction Design
* User Experience (UX)
* User Interface (UI)

UX Designers focus on how a user interacts with a product and make design
choices that are user-centric. UI Designers focus on the "look and feel" of a website.
They might choose color palettes, fonts, layouts and more.

In this course we will focus on UI/UX design by creating [__wireframes__][wireframe] to help
guide [Engineers][engineer] on how to build features defined by
[Product Managers][product].

## What is a Wireframe?

A wireframe is a tool used by designers to create a visual roadmap or blueprint for an application.
They map out where each piece of the feature will live and the overall look and skeletal framework of it.

Wireframes can be created using paper/pencil, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/),
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), or sketched out in ASCII art like the one
below.

Wireframes help [Engineers][engineer] understand the desired workflow for new
[features][product]. It allows us to try different layouts and options before
we start to build them.

Next, learn more about the role of the [Software Engineer][engineer].
