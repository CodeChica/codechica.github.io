Software Engineers depend on [Product Managers][product-manager] define what
work to do and they depend on [Designers][designer] to help them visualize what
the finished product should look like. Then Engineers identify break the work
down into [tasks](#task-breakdown), determine how long it will, and start writing code.

Engineers reduce the risk of delivering features by shipping small changes often.
Engineers write automated unit tests, apply design principles, use design patterns
and refactor code to keep code quality high and easy to maintain.

## Task Breakdown

Before starting to work on a [feature][user-story] Engineers need to make sure
that they understand the jobs to be done. To make sure that they understand the
scope of the work they create a list of tasks to accomplish.
